## Applied Software Engineering Principles

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each function app and individual function handles one specific concern
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean separation of dependencies in function implementations
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers (authentication, validation, rate limiting)
- **Fail Fast**: Early validation and clear error reporting
- **Idempotency**: Safe retry mechanisms for operations
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between different services
- **Documentation as Code**: Architecture diagrams and technical documentation in repository

## Azure Best Practices Implemented

- Proper configuration of application settings
- Secure storage of credentials and secrets
- Defensive programming with comprehensive error handling
- Efficient resource usage with appropriate trigger types
- Performance optimization through async operations
- Comprehensive logging for monitoring and diagnostics
- Cross-service authentication and authorization
